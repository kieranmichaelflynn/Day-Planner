# <Day Planner>

## Description

- My task was to create an online Day Planner using JavaScript with which would display items in rows which reflect work hours in the day and can have information saved to local storage
- I was excited at the chance of learning additional JavaScript commands, such as moment which enabled us to find and use the current time within our website
- This has been a great test of my knowledge as I have been understanding Javascript and this has provided an insight into a practical real-world application
- This site allows a user an easy and intuitive method to add notes for certain times during the day and have them kept there

## Instructions

To use my day planner, simply type your input into the input box.  Once happy, click save and your input will be stored locally for as long as you need!  As the real world time approaches the time you have entered input for, slots will change from green-future, to red-present then to gray-past.
